## Portfolio Website for Business & Data Analysis Work
This is a self-built website, created using HTML and CSS, designed to showcase my business and data analytics projects. It hosts examples of my work in data cleaning and analysis using both SQL and Python, data visualization, and reporting.

Visitors can explore:
- Analyst project walkthroughs
- Public-facing documentation and technical writing

- Embedded audio and visuals

This project highlights my skills in front-end development, technical documentation, and organizing professional assets for external audiences. It also reflects my adaptability and rapid learning in unfamiliar tech environments.
