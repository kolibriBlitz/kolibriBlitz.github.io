## 💼 Portfolio Website for Business & Data Analysis Work  

This is a self-built website, created using HTML and CSS, to showcase my business and data analytics projects. It features work in SQL, Python and Power BI for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

Visitors can explore:
- Analyst project walkthroughs  
- Public-facing documentation and technical writing  
- Data visualizations and dashboards  
- Embedded audio and visuals  

This project highlights my strengths in front-end development, technical documentation, and organizing professional assets for external audiences. It also reflects my adaptability and rapid learning in unfamiliar tech environments.
