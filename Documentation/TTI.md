# TTI Success Insights
As part of working with a career coach to help me through this time of transition, I took two assessments to analyze how I behave and what drives me. 
* [DISC](https://ttisi.com/assessments/disc): How a person does what they do through the four behavioral factors of:
  * Dominance
  * Influence
  * Steadiness
  * Compliance
* 12 Driving Forces(https://ttisi.com/assessments/12-driving-forces): Why a person does what they do.<br>
<br>The results help me clarify my goals and play to my strengths.
Read on for [more information on the assessments](https://www.ttisi.com/assessments) or [the research](https://www.ttiresearch.com/) behind them.
> My [test results](https://github.com/kolibriBlitz/kolibriBlitz.github.io/edit/main/Documents/TTI.pdf) are here.
